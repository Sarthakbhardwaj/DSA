there are three types od asymptotic notations: 
  1. Big O 
  2. Omega
  3. Theta
 
Big O: 
  it gives the WORST time complexity of te algo
  it defines if the set of functions is going to grow SLOWER than or at the same rate with respect to the expression
  this gives the MAXIMUM amount of time required by an algo 
  
Omega: 
  it defines if the set of functions will grow FASTER or at the same rate with respect to the expression
  this gives the BEST case of an algo's time complexity
  this gives the MINIMUM time required by the algo
  
Theta:
  this is used to define if the function is going to lie between Omega and Big O. 
  this is used to find the AVERAGE time reqd. 
  
  
 TIME COMPLEXITY OF SORTING ALGOS: 
  1. INSERTION SORT: O(n^2) and omega(n) 
    for very small "n" insertion sort is fastest as compared to other best ones
  2. MERGE SORT: O(n^2) and omega(nlogn)
    quicksort is a divide and conquer algo 
    FASTEST sorting algo 
  3. BUBBLE SORT: O(n^2) and omega(n)
    simplest sorting algo
    
 TIME COMPLEXITY OF SEARCHING ALGOS:
