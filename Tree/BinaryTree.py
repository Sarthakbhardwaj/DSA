If there are n nodes in a perfect binary tree, and its height is given by "logn". 
At every level the number of child nodes double so that is why

The minimum number of nodes possible at the height h of a binary tree is given by h+1

If the BT has L number of leaf nodes, then height is given by L+1

At each level i of a BT, the number of total nodes is given by 2^i

In full binary tree, if there are n number of total nodes: 
  the number of internal nodes is given by (n-1)/2
  the number of leaf nodes is given by (n+1)/2
  
COMPLETE BINARY TREE: 
  a complete binary tree is a BT in which all the elements are aaranges without missing any sequence
  all the levels are completely filled except the last level that may or may not be completely filled

PERFECT BINARY TREE: 
  if in a tree all the internal nodes have exactly two children nodes, 
  all the leaf nodes are on the same level
  a perfect binary tree with height h, the total number of nodes in this case is given by 2h-1
  
DEGENERATE BINARY TREE:
  if in a binary tree each node contains only one child node either on the left side or the right side of the tree
  they are equal to linked lists in terms of performance
