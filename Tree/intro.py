1. a tree is a non-linear collection of nodes
2. nodes represent values and nodes are connected by edges
3. top most node is ROOT
4. root, parent node, child node, leaf node(nodes which do not have any child), edge, siblings, path
5. heigh of node: it represents the number of edges on the longest path between that node and a leaf
6. level of node: root node is level 0 and then coming down
7. degree of node: number of children of a node
8. subtree

TYPES OF TREES:
  1. general tree
  2. binary tree
    a. full binary tree
    b. perfect binary tree
  3. balanced tree
  4. binary search tree
  5. avl trees:  It can be considered as a binary tree and also a type of binary search tree. It satisfies features of both binary tree and binary search tree.
It's a self balancing tree i.e. balancing heights of left subtree and right subtree. This balancing is measured by something called balancing factor.
A tree is considered as an AVL tree if it satisfies properties of both a binary search tree and the balancing factor. 
Difference between the height of the left subtree and the right subtree is considered as the height of the AVL tree.The value of the balancing factor
must be 0, 1 or -1 for each node in an AVL tree.
  6. b-tree
  7. red-black tree: It is also a variant of a binary search tree. It's also a self balancing tree just like an AVL tree, the only difference is in an AVL tree, 
    we do not have an idea as to how much rotations would be required to balance the tree but in a red black tree a maximum of two rotations are required to 
    balance the tree. It contains a bit that represents the red or black color of the node to ensure the balancing of the tree.
  
APPLICATIONS: 
  1. traversing - for example:folders in my computer 
  2. searching - 
  3. decision making - for example in netflix/prime, movie selection -> action or movies -> then movie 1 or movie 2
  4. machine learning
  
TYPES OF TREES:
  1. General tree
  2. Binary Tree
  3. Binary Search Tree
  4. AVL tress: it can be considered as a binary tree and also a type of BST. it satisfies features 
    of both BT nad BST. it is a self balancing (balancing heihgts of left subtree and right subtree. 
    this balancing is measured by something called balacing factor. the idfference between the heights of the left and right subtree should be 0,1 or -1 for each node in a n AVL tree
                                            
  5.  Red-black tree: it is also a variant of a binary search tree. it is also a self balancing 
      tree just like an AVL tree, the only difference is in an AVL tree, we do not have an idea 
      as to how much rotations would be required to balance the tree but in a red black tree a 
      mazimum of two rotations are required to balance the tree. it contains a bit that 
      represents the red or black color of the node to ensure the balacing of the tree.
