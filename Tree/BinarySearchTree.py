A BST is a sorted binary tree, where we can easily search for any key using Binary Search algo. 

To sort a BST the node's left subtree contains elements smaller than the node's key

Insertion: o(n)
Searching: o(height)
Deletion: o(n)
  
  
WHY DO WE NEED BINARY SEARCH TREES?

You: Wait!!!!! But Binary Search is already a super awesome searching algorithm. Why do we even need this so-called BST?

Rahul: Great question! Yes Binary Search is a perfect algorithm, correction: almost perfect ðŸ™‚ But it works only on a fixed sorted data set. If your data set is not sorted, or elements are added/removed from it, do you think Binary Search would perform well?

You: Ummmmmmmâ€¦â€¦..

Rahul: Letâ€™s try to understand this with an example.
